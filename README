This repository contains files that allow you to create a Ubuntu Unity Lens where you can search movies through IMDB. There are two sections. 
	In the "Movie Names" section, only the movie names are retrieved.
	In the "Genre" section, the movie names and genre are retrieved. Each movie is added to a group corresponding to the group.

This is primarily intended as a tutorial for writing Ubuntu Unity Lens using Python. For other details look at the blog post at http://saravananthirumuruganathan.wordpress.com/2011/08/05/tutorial-on-writing-ubuntu-lensesplaces-in-python/ .
